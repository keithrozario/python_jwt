# Testing JWT Tokens in Python

Exposes a Flask API for user authentication

# Pre-Requisites
You'll need an LDAP endpoint, consider using [this](https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap) by running:
    $ docker run -p 389:389 -p 636:636 --name my-openldap-container --detach osixia/openldap:1.2.4

A admin/admin user will be created automatically.

# This is still WIP!
